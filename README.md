**<h1>Simon Game</h1>**
A little something fun. The Simon game!
* Press any key on the keyboard for the game to start.
* Simon (the game) will show a button press on screen. Click that button and memorize it!
* Next round. Simon will show you another key-press. Click the one before plus the new one. With me so far? Great. 
* Next round. Simon presses yet another key. You repeat the sequence plus the new one at the end? Did you do it? Let's see how long you can keep this up!

Simon says: "in the end, I will prevail!".

Just a fun little exercise in game programing. Trying to see how simple can you make something whilst still keeping it engaging.
